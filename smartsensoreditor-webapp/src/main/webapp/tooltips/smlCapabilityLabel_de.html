		The capabilities property is intended for the definition of properties
		that further qualify the input or output of the process, component, or
		system for the purpose of discovery. These properties are defined
		using one or more SWE Common DataRecord elements. <br> Once a
		user has identified candidate sensors or processes based on the
		classifiers described above, the capabilities parameters might prove
		useful for further filtering of processes or sensor system during this
		discovery stage. Thus, the capabilities properties should be
		considered as information suitable for the discovery process.

		Beispiel: <br>A particular remote sensor on a satellite might
		measure radiation between a certain spectral range (e.g. 700 to 900
		nanometers) at a particular ground resolution (e.g. 5 meter), and with
		a typical spatial repeat period (e.g. 3.25 â€“ 4.3 days). Alternatively,
		a particular process might have certain quality constraints. Any
		process may have certain limits (e.g., operational and survivable
		limits), based on physical or mathematical conditions. These
		properties do affect the output of the process and should be
		considered as capabilities.

	<p>The capabilities element may be used to specify attributes which
		capture configuration of the sensor or describe the current status.</p>
