	<h2>Unique Identifier</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This is the "procedureId". To delete/update or get these
		metadata, this ID has to be specified. When creating new metadata and
		in "Identification" a label is named "uniqueID" then its value becomes
		the new procedureId. The value of this field is replaced with the new
		procedureId.</p>

	<p>This specification reserves the gml:identifier, inherited from
		gml:AbstractFeature, as a means of providing a unique identifier for
		the DescribedObject. This unique identifier should be referenced in
		any other specification that involves this object, thereby providing a
		means of searching for all references to this object.</p>
