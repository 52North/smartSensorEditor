# smartSensorEditor

smartSensorEditor is an extension on the [smartEditor](http://52north.org/communities/metadata-management/smarteditor). The smartEditor provides a form-based user interface to easily edit ISO 19139 and INSPIRE metadata documents, with support for templates and validation, including error highlighting. Also the data can be uploaded to an OGC CSW 2.02 endpoint to communicate with a metadata management system.

smartSensorEditor extends these functionalities to to edit metadata based on SensorML v. 2.0. Although the original smartEditor was not designed to handle any other metadata standards, it was suitable to be extended to reuse aspects such as server-side validation with Schematron, user interface and styling, and drafts and template management.


## Version Notes

This project was tested with the following versions:

* Java JDK: `1.7.x`
* Apache Maven: `3.2.3`
* Apache Tomcat: `7.0.x`
* smartEditor: `2.1.6`


## Prepare Postgres Database for smartEditor

See https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/Metadata/SmartEditorInstallationGuide#Database_preparation


## Install Sensor Editor

You must download and build the project from source using [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/):

Clone source code repository: 

```
git clone https://github.com/52North/smartSensorEditor.git
```

To build api and webapp modules, go to the project directory (by default ``smartSensorEditor``) and invoke the Maven build command:
Because of the maven notice plugin the following command needs an internet connection to check the license of the third party software.
```
cd smartSensorEditor
mvn clean install
```
The created war file ``sensorSmartEditor.war`` can then be found in: "SmartSensorEditor/smartsensoreditor-webapp/target".

Configure Tomcat: </br>
Next you have to make sure that the needed runtime environment (Java and Tomcat) are properly installed.
To make sure that the right java version is used (for linux, windoes is similar):</br>
Create a file setenv.sh (for linux) and write the following: </br>
JAVA_HOME=<Path to Java>/jdk1.7.YYYY </br>
JRE_HOME=<Path to Java>/jdk1.7.YYYY/jre </br>
If another program should run on the tomcat then the an additional line in setenv.sh has to be added: </br>
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xms128m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -server" </br>

Quick start: </br>
Put the file ``sensorSmartEditor.war`` into the webapp folder of Tomcat and start Tomcat. 

Start with all features: </br>
If the feature for storing templates should be available, then additionally a database has to be created. For more information please take a look at the following link:</br> https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/Metadata/SmartEditorInstallationGuide#Database_preparation </br>
The database URL, username, the password and the database driver have to be accessible for Tomcat. The instructions can be found at this link: </br>
https://wiki.52north.org/bin/view/Metadata/SmartEditorInstallationGuide#Servlet_container_configuration


Then open the browser at http://localhost:8080/smartSensorEditor.
The form for SensorML can be opened by clicking on the button "Sensor".

### Code Structure

smartSensorEditor is a Maven overlay of the original smartEditor webapp. It consists of two modules:

* ``smartSensorEditor-api``: Java classes
* ``smartSensorEditor-webapp``: the web application, building on smartEditor-webapp. The [maven-war-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/) with its [overlay functionality](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/overlays.html) is used to replace and add new files.

smartEditor uses the [Spring Framework](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) and all configuration happens via Spring Beans in XML files. For processing of XML documents, smartEditor uses a combination of XSLT and Groovy. For the front end Java Server Pages (jsp) are used. Therefore files of all of the above types were added to adjust smartEditor for SensorML and unit tests were written to ensure working code.

### Build sub modules of the project

If only one of the sub modules should be build with maven, then go to the main folder of the whole project. With the attribute -pl a specific modul can be selected:

```
mvn clean package -pl smartsensoreditor-webapp
```

With the following command all dependencies of the module are build as well ([details](http://blog.sonatype.com/2009/10/maven-tips-and-tricks-advanced-reactor-options)):

```
mvn clean package -pl smartsensoreditor-webapp -am
```


### How to start the integration tests?

By default no integration tests are executed during the command "clean install". The integration test checks the communication between the SmartSensorEditor and the SOS. The following operations are checked:
<p>get/insert/update/delete sensor description.</p>
If you would like to execute them, then you need to create a build.properties file. You have to define the service url and the authorization token of the SOS. It should look like that:
<p>
IT_serviceURL:http://localhost:XX/XX/service </br>
IT_authorizationToken:XXX 
</p>
This propwerty file should be put into your home folder (/home/person for linux).
To build the maven project and execute the integration test go to the main folder of the SmartSensorEditor project. With the attribute -P a specific Profile can be chosen. 
Use the following command to start the integration tests for the SmartSensorEditor:

```
mvn -P itestsos clean install
```


### How can I adjust the editor?
